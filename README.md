 3. Created a test template page -> inherited by all the tests. Itâ€™s like a blueprint of a test.

 5. Created Test Runner(A test runner is the library or tool that picks up an assembly (or a source code directory) that contains unit tests, and a bunch of settings, and then executes them and writes the test results to the console or log files.) run tests sequentially using simple TextTestRunner
